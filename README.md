# python_visualizer
python visualizations for algorithms and data structures

### user stories
- as a non-user i want to see a warm welcoming page that introduced the application and it's functions
- as a non-user i want to preview a few explanations of rudimentary data structures
- then i want to be prompted to "learn more by creating a free account"
- as a user, i want the welcoming page to show my favorited data structures/algorithms
- as a user, i want to have a selection between data structures and algorithms
- as a user viewing data structures, i want to see individual cards with basic information on each data structure
- as a user, when clicking a data structure card, i want to see expanded version of the data structure that give in depth explanation with a visual explanation
- as a user, viewing algorithms, i want to see individual cards with basic information on top sorting algorithms
- as a user, when clicking an algorithm card, i want to see expanded explanation of algorithm
- as a user, i want to see visualization of algorithm working through either a default data set or a data set i enter through an input field
- as a user, i want to have the ability to store favorite data structures or algorithms for quicker access (welcome page)

- as a stretch goal, i would like to implement multiple choice formatted tests on each data structure and algorithm, prompting users on the welcome page to study the algorithms or data structures they have least correct answers in.
